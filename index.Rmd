## Bio

Kaitlyn Lee is a third year PhD student in Biostatistics at the UC Berkeley mentored by 
[Professor Alejandro Schuler](https://ctml.berkeley.edu/people/alejandro-schuler-phd). Her research interests are 
broadly in causal inference, machine learning, and methods research. She is 
interested in developing methods to answer real-world questions about health and 
social policy in a statistically rigorous manner. Her current work focuses on 
efficient estimation of causal quantities using machine learning algorithms.
